================
The idea to hybridize the audio input and control voltage stages from the MKS80 and SH101, respectively, comes directly from
the AMSynths AM8060: http://www.amsynths.co.uk/products/filters/am8060se/

UPDATE
======
Currently working on v1.3 which will add voltage controlled resonance and attenuverter on one CV input. Stay tuned.
